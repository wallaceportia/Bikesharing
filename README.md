# Bikesharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the Citi-Bike, “bike sharing” business model. The purpose of doing this is that the model can be used by our two young entrepreneurs; who will like to start a bike sharing venture in Des Moines. The data from Citi Bike will be viewed by stakeholders for the new venture in Des Moines to analyze the viability of the business model as well as understand how it functions. 

## Results:

**Days of the Week/Subscriber: Viz Type - _Heat- Map_**

![Days of the Week/Subscriber](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.PNG)

* This heat map demonstrates three main points:

* The main stream of users(riders) are subscribers 

* Secondly weekdays are more popular with **subscribers** with the lowest count is _**3,528**_ occurs on Sunday, and the highest count of _**259,316**_ occurring on a Thursday 

* Thirdly for **customers** ridership is more popular on weekends for all both male and females with Saturday being the most popular day, the highest count being _**55,375**_ 

**Mainly Men are Pushing Pedals on Weekdays: Viz Type - _Heat- Map_**

![Mainly Men are Pushing Pedals on Weekdays!](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Gender(Weekday%20per%20Hour).PNG)

* This heat map demonstrates three main points:

* Males are the main users of Citi Bike

* Ridership is highest during the week with the Thursday being the most popular day

* The most popular times of the day for riders seems to rush hours (getting to work period) mornings 8am is the most popular time on a Thursday with 25,694 male riders. Thrusday evenings see the highest ridership at 5pm and 6pm the highest count being Thursday evenings with _**30,749**_ at 6PM

**Average Length of rides for Pedal Pushers: Viz Type - _Line Chart_** 

![Average Length of Rides for Pedal Pushers](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.PNG)

* This chart demonstrates that the most rides have an average duration peaking at approximately 5 minuets with the ridership count at _**146,752**_ as the trip time approaches 60 minutes the ridership falls to _**1,122**_

**Length of rides for Pedal Pushers by Gender: Viz Type - _Multi-Line Chart_**

![Length of rides for Pedal Pushers by Gender](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.PNG)

* This chart demonstrates that for both male and female most rides last a duration of **5 minutes** with a ridership of _**108,087**_ for men and _**34,151**_ for females. As the trip time approaches **60 minutes** for males this numbers **decreases** to _**413**_ and for females it **decreases** to _**347**_.  This may indicate that trip duration is not affected by sex but we might infer it is distance from start and end stations target destinations.  We might also infer that this is during the heat of NYC summer and riders may be less inclined to long rides.

**Most Popular Pedal Pushing Days/Time: Viz Type: _Heat Map_**

![Most Popular Pedal Pushing Days/Time](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20Per%20Hour.PNG)

* This heat map demonstrate two main points:

* Firstly we see that the overall the most poupular bike useage times occur during the week between 8am and 9am and in the evening between 5pm to 6pm with highest count on Thursdays at _**44,905**_ at **6pm**.

* In addtion to the weekends the most off peak hours of use is between 12am and 5am with the _**lowest**_ at **3am** a _**360**_ count on Tuesday mornings.

**Pedal in the Heart of the City: Viz Type - _Map_**

![Pedal in the Heart of the City](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Start%20Station%2C%20Trip%20Duration(Week%20Day).PNG)

* An observation of this map allows us to see that most rides begin and end(not shown here) in the borough of Manhattan.  Manhattan is a hub for much of the city's employment.  We can infer that individuals may travel to their nearest train stop or taxi hub and continue their ride to work using a citi bike.  
* It can also be observed from this map that Thursday's is the most popular ridership day

**Trips by Birth Year: Viz Type - _Multi_Line Chart_**

![Trips by Birth Year](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Birth%20Year.PNG)

* This chart demonstrates the following:

* The typical male rider is between the ages of 30 to 32 years old with the top year of birth 1990 peaking at 71,334 riders.

* The typical female ride is between the ages of 31 to 33 years old with the top year of birth 1989 peaking at 31,801 riders.
* There is an outlier of persons born in 1969 (52 years); this data may possibily mis-labelled data or this group of people might belong to a special riding club.

## Summary:

We can summize that most of Citi Bike's customers are male subscribers.  These subscribers tend to use bikeshareing mainly during the week at peek travel times in the morning before work and in the evening after work.  The highest average usage time is 5 minutes, which may suggest that the bikes are being used for more of a functional rather than leisurely use.  Bikesharing is most popular with age groups 30 to 33 year old (refer to chart "Trips by Birth Year") Bikeshareing is more popular with customers on weekends, these are the people who are more than likely using the bike for leisure purposes.  However both among subscribers and customers bikesharing is very popular in populous neighborhoods.

In terms of the recommendation for bikesharing in **Des Moines** there might be two considerations that are of importance:

* Much of Citi Bikes revenue come from subscribers and these are males who most likely work in the borough of Manhattan.  It is important to note that the borough of Manhattan has an estimate4d population of 1.63 million people and a population density of 70,826.  It therefore made business sense when Citi Bike expanded that many bike stations were placed in Manhattan close to metro-system(it even more wise considering how unreliable the metro system is in the city). The largest metropoliton in Iowa is Des Moines with a metro population of 214, 133 and a population density of 2,390. Referring to the map "Pedal in the Heart of the City", we can observe that there is hight traffic for bikesharing near large densely populated boroughs, therefore on both the in both the introductory phase or expansion phase of bikesharing in a relatively medium to small poulated area like Des Moines, it would be wise to start slow and not make large rash investments.  

* Secondly it can be observed that age has a strong influence on bikesharing (Refer to chart "Trips by Birth Year". Therefore it would be wise as this model is being introduced to conduct studies on age dispersion in the population, this might be a great indicator as to good locations for bike hubs.
