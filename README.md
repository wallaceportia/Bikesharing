## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the Citi-Bike, “bike sharing” business model. The purpose of doing this is that the model can be used by our two young entrepreneurs; who will like to start a bike sharing venture in Des Moines. The data from Citi Bike will be viewed by stakeholders for the new venture in Des Moines to analyze the viability of the business model as well as understand how it functions.
